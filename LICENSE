GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 19 November 2007

Copyright (C) 2023 PaoloJN
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

### Preamble

The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure cooperation with the community in the case of network server software. If the software is modified and used on a server, the AGPL ensures that the complete source code of the modified software is available to the users of that server.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.

This License is a specific implementation of the GNU General Public License, with the additional provision that if you run a modified program on a server and make it interact with users remotely through that server, you must also provide the users with the source code corresponding to the modified version. Developers that use the GNU AGPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

For exact terms, conditions, and the full text of the license, see below.
